  "description": "Besides the dictionary meaning of 「to tease, to joke」, it is also used in the same way as sexual harassment (xing sao rao) and to take liberties with someone. Many people use 「eating tofu」 (chi doufu) as a euphemism for 「sexual harassment」. There is a theory that because tofu is highly nutritious and eating it is said to make skin fine and fair (hence the term 「Tofu Beauty」), this expression came about.",
