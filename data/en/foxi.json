  "description": "「Foxi」 (Buddhist style) refers to a person who is free-spirited, has no obsessions, no desire to show off or compete, and does things at their own pace. It describes a type of person who doesn't care about trivial matters. Often used as a synonym for the 「post-90s」 generation, it can be seen as a reaction to the pressure of being an only child. Instead of pursuing external status, fame, or money, they pursue internal fulfillment. It likens this attitude to the Buddhist spirit of an enlightened Buddha.",
